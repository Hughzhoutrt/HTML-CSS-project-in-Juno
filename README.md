# CSS-HTML_Project  

These two projects are built during my web dev course in Juno college.  

About the projects:  

###Front End Beginner Alert### :P  

Web development course is my first front-end course and it definitely attracts me and leads me go into the industry.  

I am still learning, trying to build myself to be a good programer!  

The first project was built before I learnt flex box so I tried to use relative/absulote position. But it may have some issue in cross-browser compatibility. Then, I was trying to resize the pic but in a unsuitable method (set it as background pic without something for screen reader, it decreased the accessibility.  

Based on the summary of project 1, the cross-browser compatibility and accessibility are respected in my project 2.

Areas of improvement:  
Project 1:  
1. properly using semantic elements;    
2. grapic section leaving dark to screen reader;  
3. heavily relay on positions;  
4. heavily relay on id selectors;  
5. single space.  

Project 2:  
1. naming as snake_case, kebab-case, or camelCase for naming classes and IDs.  
2. for the menu it would be best to use a button or tag.  
3. try using rems, pixels, percentages, or calc for padding and margin, borders and font sizes.  
4. don't forget to update the title to be more descriptive as this title can be used for SEO.

# CSS-HTML_Project  

These two projects are built during my web dev course in Juno college.  

About the projects:  

###Front End Beginner Alert### :P  

Web development course is my first front-end course and it definitely attracts me and leads me go into the industry.  

I am still learning, trying to build myself to be a good programer!  

The first project was built before I learnt flex box so I tried to use relative/absulote position. But it may have some issue in cross-browser compatibility. Then, I was trying to resize the pic but in a unsuitable method (set it as background pic without something for screen reader, it decreased the accessibility.  

Based on the summury of project 1, the cross-browser compatibility and accessibility are respected in my project 2.

These two projects are built during my web dev course in Juno college.

About the projects:  

## Front End Beginner Alert  :P  

This two projects were built when I just started my web development, especially the project 1. They are my course projects, which means how I built them is following the design templates and requirements.   
    
The first project was built before I learnt flex box so I tried to use relative/absulote position. But it may have some issue in cross-browser compatibility. Then, I was trying to resize the pic but in a unsuitable method (set it as background pic without something for screen reader, it decreased the accessibility.)  

Based on the summary of project 1, the cross-browser compatibility and accessibility are respected in my project 2.

### Areas of improvement:  
Project 1:  
1. properly using semantic elements;    
2. grapic section leaving dark to screen reader;  
3. heavily relay on positions;  
4. heavily relay on id selectors;  
5. single space.  

Project 2:  
1. naming as snake_case, kebab-case, or camelCase for naming classes and IDs.  
2. for the menu it would be best to use a button or tag.  
3. try using rems, pixels, percentages, or calc for padding and margin, borders and font sizes.  
4. don't forget to update the title to be more descriptive as this title can be used for SEO.  

### Summary  
I re-organized this respository after I completed my JavaScript course and wait for my web dev boot camp. Stand back and review these past months, I can feel my improvement, which is accumulated by searching new concepts and knowledge, doing exercises, making mistakes, studying feedbacks... It is good! This is how I improve myself. So appreciate to those who support me in my front end development study, my good friends, my instructors, my mentors.
